# Spark-ETL-Pipeline-
This project implements an automated data processing pipeline that retrieves CSV files from Amazon S3, validates their schema against required columns, processes them, and loads the data into a MySQL database. The pipeline handles error scenarios by moving invalid files to a designated error directory both locally and in S3.
